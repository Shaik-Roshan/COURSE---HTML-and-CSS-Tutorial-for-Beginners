      History
      George Safford Parker, the founder, had previously been a sales agent for the John Holland Gold Pen Company. He
      received his first fountain pen related patent in 1889.[3] In 1894 Parker received a patent on his "Lucky Curve"
      fountain pen feed,[4] which was claimed to draw excess ink back into the pen barrel when the pen was not in use.
      The
      company's first successful pen, released in 1899, was the Parker Jointless. The Lucky Curve feed was used in
      various
      forms until 1928.[5]

  Several models of the Parker 51, regarded as the most widely used model of fountain pen
  From the 1920s to the 1960s, before the development of the ballpoint pen, Parker was either number one or number two
  in worldwide writing instrument sales. In 1931, Parker created Quink (quick drying ink), which eliminated the need
  for blotting.[6] In 1941, the company developed the most widely used model of fountain pen in history (over $400
  million worth of sales in its 30-year history), the Parker 51.[7][8] Manufacturing facilities were set up over the
  years in Canada, United Kingdom, Denmark, France, Mexico, USA, Pakistan, India, Germany (Osmia-Parker), Brazil and
  Argentina.[citation needed]

  Parker Jotter pen
  In 1954 Parker released the Parker Jotter ballpoint[9] pen with its original nylon body and inverted "V" clip. The
  Jotter would go on to sell over 750 million units during its history. In 1955, the company introduced its Liquid
  Lead pencil which used liquid graphite to write like a pen. Unfortunately, the Scripto company had introduced a
  similar product called Fluidlead a few months previously. To avoid a costly patent fight the companies agreed to
  share their formulas with each other.[10]

  The company bought retailer and catalog company Norm Thompson in 1973, and then sold it in 1981.[11] In 1976 Parker
  acquired Manpower just as the temporary staffing market was surging. In time Manpower provided more revenue than the
  pen business. A 1982 spinoff, Sintered Specialties, Inc., became SSI Technologies, a manufacturer of automotive
  sensors.[citation needed]

  A management buyout in 1986, moved the company's headquarters to Newhaven, East Sussex, England, which was the
  original location of the Valentine Pen Company previously acquired by Parker. In 1993 Parker was purchased by the
  Gillette Company, which already owned the Paper Mate brand - the best-selling disposable ballpoint. In 2000 Gillette
  sold its writing instruments division to the company Newell Rubbermaid, whose Sanford Stationery Division became the
  largest writing instrument manufacturers in the world at that time, simultaneously owning such brand names as
  Rotring, Sharpie, Reynolds as well as Parker, PaperMate, Waterman, and Liquid Paper.[citation needed]

  With commercial competition increasing upon the Parker Jotter's classic metal ink refill cartridge design from low
  cost generic copies produced in China, as Parker's unique design patent for the cartridge expired, Parker's sales
  began to be drastically adversely affected. In July 2009 Newell Rubbermaid Inc. in response announced that it had
  decided to close down the Parker production factory at Newhaven in England with the dismissal of 180 employees from
  the facility, and relocate production to France.[12] The following month, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. announced that the
  factory in Janesville, Wisconsin, was also to close the remaining operation there producing Parker Pens (which
  eliminated a further 153 manufacturing jobs). The company press release stated: "This decision is a response to
  structural issues accelerated by market trends and is in no way a reflection on the highly valued work performed by
  our Janesville employees over the years." Newell Rubbermaid offered 'transitional employment services' along with
  severance pay in compensation to the dismissed workforce.[13][14]

  Subsequently, Parker has abandoned its traditional retail outlets in North America. While some of its former staple
  Jotter pens may be found in retailers such as Office Depot, the Parker line has been moved to upscale "luxury"
  retailers in an abandonment of its former business model of quality manufacture combined with mass market appeal and
  pricing.[citation needed] With this commercial strategic move Parker also altered its traditional product warranty
  on its high end pens, changing the former lifetime guarantee to a two-year warranty limitation.[15]

  Parker Pen Co. was an aviation pioneer. The interest of Parker Pen Co. about aircraft came from Kenneth Parker, son
  of the founder, he enlisted in the fledgling air service and, after flight training at Miami Air Base, Kenneth was
  assigned to officer training in tactical maneuvers at Pensacola Naval Air Station, Florida. From their first company
  business plane, the Parker Duofold Fairchild, they used it as an innovative advertising weapon inviting his
  dealers.[16] Between the 1920s and 1960s, Parker maintained a considerable air fleet.
